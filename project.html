    <p>
        Plant care refers to providing plants with proper nutrients, so that they can continue to grow. The issue is that a lot of new plant owners generally don’t know where to start with this because there are a lot of different things that go into caring for a plant.
    </p>

    <p>
        Plant care is something that people who have never had plants may be confused about as it is unexplored territory. Individuals who are new to plant care may not know what kind of house plant they should buy for their home. When researching plant care for a specific plant, there are various sources that discuss different specifications such as the recommended kinds of products, the time constraints, and other factors. With hundreds of different sources, it becomes overwhelming to the user and further confuses them. Our web app addresses that issue and combines information from various credible sources to make an effective and informational website that is perfect for new plant owners.

        Bloomscape and Florish are two examples of existing attempts to solve this problem. Bloomscape is an app that allows users to create a watering/fertilizing schedule for their plants, track their plant collection, and view plant care tips. Florish helps you find the perfect plant for your needs, receive care instructions, get reminders, and find the right lighting.

        It is an all too common occurrence to see someone purchase a plant for their home with the intention of paying attention to its needs with consistency, but end up not able to keep up with the care that is required. Oftentimes, the issue ends up being that instructions for proper care aren’t made aware to the plant owner or that they don’t have the knowledge or awareness to choose a plant that best fits their lifestyle beforehand. Additionally, experienced plant owners could also benefit from a single resource that displays species suggestions, care tips, etc. A web app could find these users’ preferences, provide them with helpful information, and help them nurture their plants.

        The primary users of this application are people who are new to taking care of their own plants as well as those who are already familiar with plant care, but would like a more structured system for care.

        “Half” Feature: One interactive feature is a page with a range of different kinds of basic house plants in a card format. One side will have the name and picture of a specific plant and when you click on the card and flip it over, the other side will have a few facts about the plant such as watering schedule, environment needed, pest control, and other basic information. 
    </p>
    <p>
        First Feature: This feature will be an interactive quiz that considers information about the user and suggests a type of plant that they should consider buying and caring for. The quiz will have questions such as “How much free time do you have?”, “Have you had any plants in the past?”, “What is the weather like where you live?”, etc. Based on these questions, we will provide a category or type of plant that best fits the user. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Second Feature: This feature is something that is essential for new plant owners. Many people have the issue of misunderstanding how often to water plants. They either overwater or do not water enough. That issue is solved with an interactive calendar that will generate the watering schedule of your plant automatically after you choose the kind of plant you own. If you choose to do so, this calendar will also notify you on watering day.</p>
