        "WATERING": "If you give the Croton too little water, the leaves will fall. Too much water will create a similar effect. During growth, the soil should be evenly moist most of the time. It should be moist, not soggy or wet. If you can pour water out of the pot, or there is wetness in the drip tray an hour after watering you're giving the plant too much water. If you're letting the soil dry out completely before watering again, you 're not watering it enough. In winter you need to water your plant much less often – let the top inch dry out fully between waterings. This will prevent overwatering.",

It grows slightly slower in less light, but there’s no significant difference in the leaf color. More than three hours of full sun can affect the leaves, causing them to develop brown tips and spots. It’s ideal to give the plant partial to full shade when treated as an outdoor plant.",
        "HUMIDITY": "Medium",
        "WATERING": "Even watering your plant is low maintenance. The plant is drought-tolerant, and overwatering the spider plants is the biggest concern. You can let the soil dry out between watering by testing the soil with your finger. Then you can drench the root ball and allow the excess water to run out from the drainage holes in the pot. Still, if you notice brown tips on the leaves, check the chemicals in the water you provide. Your plant is sensitive to the minerals in tap water like chlorine and fluoride. Some municipalities have a lot of these in the water. If the leaf tips turn brown, we recommend leaving the water standing overnight for the chemicals to evaporate. Or you can use distilled water or rainwater where possible.",

        "WATERING": "You must provide your Cyperus with a high level of water saturation at all times to keep it healthy. Try to keep the drip tray topped up at all times.

In a darker space, the plant will grow slower and need less water, but it will adapt. It’s best not to move the plant into a brighter space to give it extra light for a short time, as the sudden extra sunlight can burn its leaves. Some minimal direct sun is fine, but these plants easily thrive without it and grow quickly in any well-lit space.",
        "HUMIDITY": "Low",
        "WATERING": "Generally, you can water your Ivy when half the soil is dry in the warmer months, and when the soil is dry in the colder months. Time between watering will vary but it can be as often as once a week in the peak of summer or once a month in the dead of winter. The plant will very visibly wilt when it desperately needs water. Essentially, no damage will occur from under-watering your plant, so it is always better to err on the side of too dry than too wet. To fully hydrate the soil, be sure to soak your plant.",

        "WATERING": "When it comes to watering, less is more. Donkey's tail is drought resistant once established, so you should water it more frequently during the spring and summer growing season, and taper off in the fall and winter months. Generally, opt for a single heavy watering each month if your plant is indoors, increasing to once every two or three weeks if it’s outdoors. Check the soil with your finger to make sure the soil is dry at least an inch down before watering the plant. To aid in drainage, choose a pot with holes at its base; a terracotta or clay material can also help wick water from the soil.",
