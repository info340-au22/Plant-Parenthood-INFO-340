You can let the soil dry out between watering by testing the soil with your finger. Then you can drench the root ball and allow the excess water to run out from the drainage holes in the pot. Still, if you notice brown tips on the leaves, check the chemicals in the water you provide. Your plant is sensitive to the minerals in tap water like chlorine and fluoride. Some municipalities have a lot of these in the water. If the leaf tips turn brown, we recommend leaving the water standing overnight for the chemicals to evaporate.

If you’re keeping your plant indoors, opt for a sunny windowsill that provides several hours of daily light. If you're growing your succulent outdoors, put it somewhere that gets plenty of morning sunlight but is partially shaded during more aggressive afternoon hours to avoid scorching its leaves.",

        "WATERING": "When it comes to watering, less is more. Donkey's tail is drought resistant once established, so you should water it more frequently during the spring and summer growing season, and taper off in the fall and winter months. Generally, opt for a single heavy watering each month if your plant is indoors, increasing to once every two or three weeks if it’s outdoors. Check the soil with your finger to make sure the soil is dry at least an inch down before watering the plant. To aid in drainage, choose a pot with holes at its base; a terracotta or clay material can also help wick water from the soil.",

Get them acclimatised for a week or so by moving them into the sun for an hour or so a day then back into shade again, gradually increasing the time in the sun.
