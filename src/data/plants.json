Still, if you notice brown tips on the leaves, check the chemicals in the water you provide. Your plant is sensitive to the minerals in tap water like chlorine and fluoride.

        "WATERING": "When it comes to watering, less is more. Donkey's tail is drought resistant once established, so you should water it more frequently during the spring and summer growing season, and taper off in the fall and winter months. Generally, opt for a single heavy watering each month if your plant is indoors, increasing to once every two or three weeks if it’s outdoors. Check the soil with your finger to make sure the soil is dry at least an inch down before watering the plant. To aid in drainage, choose a pot with holes at its base; a terracotta or clay material can also help wick water from the soil.",

Sitting on a North facing window ledge, close to an East or West facing window or some distance away from a South facing one are all good locations. The leaves will scorch if it's too bright. If it's too dark, newer leaves will be small and limp looking.",
