        <h2>Why plant care?</h2>
        <p>
            Plant care refers to providing plants with proper nutrients, so that they can continue to grow. The issue is that a lot of new plant owners generally don’t know where to start with this because there are a lot of different factors that go into caring for a plant.
                        
            It is an all too common occurrence to see someone purchase a plant for their home with the intention of paying attention to its needs with consistency, but end up not able to keep up with the care that is required. Often, the issue ends up being that instructions for proper care aren’t made aware to the plant owner or that the owner doesn’t have the knowledge or awareness to choose a plant that best fits their lifestyle. We believe that even experienced plant owners could benefit from a single resource that displays species suggestions, care tips, etc. A web app could find these users’ preferences, provide them with helpful information, and help them nurture their plants.</p>
